"""Generic safe form workflow — generalizes the mature AuthWorkflow state-machine
pattern (app.agent.auth_strategy) to ANY safe data-entry form: "create test
customer/contact/employee", checkout information, add-product-to-cart-adjacent
forms, and similar. AuthenticationStrategy's own login/registration machinery is
untouched — this is a parallel, independent engine for non-auth forms, not a
refactor of it, so authentication behaviour carries zero risk from this change.

Emits ordinary BrowserActions (FILL/SELECT/CHECK/CLICK) through the normal
Planner -> ActionValidator -> ActionExecutor -> BrowserAdapter pipeline — this
workflow never touches Playwright directly and never invents a selector.

Must NEVER plan a delete / real-payment / account-closure / irreversible-production
step. Safety is enforced at TWO layers: (1) the gate deciding which forms are even
eligible to start a workflow (safe_test_data_create's existing keyword exclusions
plus the DISALLOWED_SUBMIT_HINTS check on the submit control below), and (2) the
ActionValidator, which independently re-checks every action regardless of what this
workflow requests.
