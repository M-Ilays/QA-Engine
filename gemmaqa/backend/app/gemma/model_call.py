"""The provider transport layer's request/response vocabulary.

Two layers, deliberately separate:

  app.gemma.base.GenerationRequest   CONTEXT layer. What one model call should
                                     say: the rendered system/user prompts, the
                                     evidence registry, the projection and
                                     reduction records. Produced by
                                     `prepare_generation_request()`, which every
                                     provider goes through so their contexts are
                                     equivalent rather than merely similar.

  ModelCallRequest / ModelCallResult TRANSPORT layer (this module). How that
                                     call is made and what came back: model id,
                                     decoding knobs, token counts, latency, stop
                                     reason, raw payload.

They are NOT the same object under two names, and neither replaces the other.
`GenerationRequest` keeps its meaning untouched; a provider call takes a
`GenerationRequest`'s prompts and carries them in a `ModelCallRequest`.

Nothing here imports an SDK. This module is pure data, so it stays importable
in an environment with no provider backends installed at all — the same
property that lets `GEMMA_PROVIDER=mock` run without transformers.

Two conventions inherited from the rest of the codebase, both load-bearing:

1. **Absence is absence.** A token count the provider did not report is `None`,
   never `0`. "The model used no input tokens" and "this provider does not tell
   us" are different facts, and a report that shows `0` for both is wrong. The
   same reasoning as `ActionGenerationRequest.testing_objective_provided` and
   the graded activation basis.
2. **Telemetry is opt-in, not opt-out.** `telemetry()` builds the loggable view
   by naming the safe fields, so prompt text, raw payloads and anything in
   `metadata` cannot reach a log by default. A denylist would leak the first
   field someone forgot to add to it.
