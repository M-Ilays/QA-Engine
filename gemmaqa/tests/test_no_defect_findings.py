"""A model reporting "nothing is wrong" must not produce a defect.

Live on a cloud model, run 47704fde: **27 of 32 recorded "defects" were the
model saying there was no defect** — titles like "No defects detected on the
login page", severity minor, one per action. The report's bug count was
meaningless.

Why the existing filter did not catch it. The prompt said:

    "If nothing looks defective, use classification 'observation' with low
     confidence."

and the parser dropped observations below confidence 0.35. That reads the
confidence field as "how likely is this a defect". A real model reads it as "how
sure are you" — and it is VERY sure the page is fine. So a confident "nothing is
wrong" arrived as a high-confidence observation and sailed through the gate.

The fields, taken verbatim from that run:

    genuine finding   expected: "No sensitive information ... should be displayed"
                      actual:   "An alert containing default login credentials
                                 ... is displayed"          <- a real discrepancy

    false positive    expected: "The login page should display without errors"
                      actual:   "The login page displayed as expected with no
                                 console errors"            <- expectation MET

The fix gives the model an unambiguous way to say it (`no_defect`) and stops the
parser depending on a numeric side-channel whose meaning was ambiguous.
