Exploratory QA of **Demo** at `https://demo.gemmaqa.local/` visited 3 unique page(s), explored 3, executed 1 action(s), generated 2 scenario(s), and recorded 1 confirmed bug(s) and 1 suspected issue(s). Observed exploratory coverage 100.0% (not complete application coverage). Stop reason: action_budget_sample.

## Configuration and Capability Disclosure

- **Provider:** Mock
- **Model:** None
- **Provider capability mode:** exploration_only
- **Browser adapter:** Direct Playwright
- **Autonomous investigation:** disabled
- **Controlled writes:** disabled
- **Safe mode:** on

> **Provider is Mock: exploration-only.

Generated-scenario counts under this provider are not a claim of autonomous CRUD testing capability.**

## Temporary Records

_No temporary test records were created this run._

## Cleanup Status

- Succeeded: 0
- Pending: 0
- Manual cleanup required: 0
- Cleanup coverage: 0.0%

## Regression Checklist

- [ ] Critical navigation paths remain reachable
- [ ] Primary forms render without console errors
- [ ] No new network 5xx on core pages
- [ ] Page titles remain present on explored pages
- [ ] Required fields reject empty submission

## Console Errors

- `TypeError: x is undefined`

## Network Errors

- `500 GET /api/session Authorization: ***REDACTED***`

## Evidence Index

## Stop Reason

- **Why did the run stop?** action_budget_sample
- **Last meaningful operation:** click on el_020
- **What remained untested?** 0 scenario(s), 2 form(s), 0 CRUD operation(s)
- **What prevented execution?** n/a
- **Temporary records left behind:** 0

**Recommended configuration changes for the next run:**
- No configuration changes indicated — nothing left blocked this run.

## Known Limitations

- Exploration is budget-limited and does not claim complete coverage.
- Single authenticated role unless multiple credentials were provided.
- Destructive, payment, invite, and messaging actions remain blocked.
- Gemma wording assistance must not invent pages, bugs, or evidence.
- Provider: Mock | Browser adapter: Direct Playwright
- Run stop reason: action_budget_sample

## Recommended Next Testing Areas

- Explore unvisited application URL: https://demo.gemmaqa.local/settings
- Increase controlled-write tests on remaining forms (safe test data only).
- Triage suspected bugs with targeted reproduction.
